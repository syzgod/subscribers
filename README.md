## Description

A simple App using API and MUI(Material UI) for React. The purpose of the project was to deepen my understand of handling APIs and to work with MUI to get familiar with a component library so in the future I can develop websites efficient and be able to use other component libraries as well. Added Redux Toolkit to the tech stack so I could learn a bit more about it and use it in a live project. 

## Inspired by few of the tutorials found online

### Things I learned:
- How to work with React and MUI components together
- How to work with MUI and components libraries in general with built in props and styling
- How to use Redux Toolkit as a global state management system

### Challenges during building the project:
- The MUI library was at challenge first but as soon as I got familiar with the system I got much better at using it
- Redux Toolkit definitely was a challenge as it is pretty complex
- Pagination was hard to understand first even though I used the Pagination component from MUI

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The currentPage will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
